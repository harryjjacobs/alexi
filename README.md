# alexi
a twitter bot joke version of alexa that answers questions badly

Uses open source voice assistant [https://mycroft.ai/](https://mycroft.ai) as the brains and replaces random words with rhyming (and non-rhyming) words.

mycroft must be set up and running on the host computer. mycroft_bus_client is used to talk to it.
